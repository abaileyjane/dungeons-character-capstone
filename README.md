Dragon’s Horde: A Dungeons and Dragons Character Storage Keeper

Dragon’s Horde is a storage application for characters from the role-playing tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. It was created as a capstone project for the Thinkful coding bootcamp. 


Dragon’s Horde seeks to solve the problem of losing or misplacing your character information. Traditionally, D and D players write and record all of their character information on paper, and then keep that same paper for reference/update at each of their subsequent playing sessions. The likelihood of that one paper getting lost, destroyed or rendered unreadable is high. Thats where Dragon’s Horde comes in. Each game day, all the user must do is access the app and pull up the information for the character they intend to play as that day. Gain some experience points? No problem! With Dragon’s Horde, you can easily update any information on your character. Finished with your character or did it die in combat? After clicking on that characters information page, simply click “Kill” and your character is gone forever.
